title: Writing recursive-descent parsers in TypeScript

I'm having a lot of fun learning about and writing recursive-descent parsers in TypeScript, especially writing my own mini-lisp in TypeScript.

I made an [interactive parser/evaluator playground](https://adueck.github.io/parser-practice) that anyone interested can check out and follow along with [as I work on it](https://github.com/adueck/parser-practice).

**Edit**: I've expanded my little mini-lisp exercise as I'm working through [PLAI](https://www.plai.org) and building a more full rounded interpreter and language. I'm calling [PLAIScript](https://adueck.github.io/plaiscript).
